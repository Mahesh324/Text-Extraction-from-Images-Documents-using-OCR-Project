# Text-Extraction-from-Images-Documents-using-OCR-Project
This project was to develop a web portal that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology for the extraction of text from images and documents.  It will provide users with a convenient and efficient means of converting textual content embedded within various visual media into editable and searchable formats.
